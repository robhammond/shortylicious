A minimalist URL shortener based on Mojolicious and CouchDB. For a live example see
http://bkx.me/

Installation:
-------------
Only requires Mojolicious to be installed and access to a CouchDB server,
either installed locally or through a third party service such as www.iriscouch.com.

If you are using a 3rd party CouchDB host you'll most likely need to ensure that
IO::Socket::SSL is installed so Mojolicious can communicate with the secure host.

Configuration:
--------------
Edit the shorty_app.conf file to change the default brand/domain where it will be hosted 
and the details for the CouchDB instance. The CouchDB database will need to exist.

Notes:
------
 - While CouchDB is currently the only database supported it would be relatively trivial
   to add support for other DBs
 - No hit stats are currently recorded but this would be easy to add into the route 
   subroutine in /lib/ShortyApp/Controller.pm
 - Only basic HTTP auth is supported for CouchDB right now
