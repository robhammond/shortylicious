A minimalist URL shortener based on Mojolicious and MongoDB. For a live example see
http://bkx.me/

Installation:
-------------
Only requires Perl (5.10+), Mojolicious & MongoDB (CPAN module & server app).

If you are using a 3rd party DB host you'll most likely need to ensure that
IO::Socket::SSL is installed so Mojolicious can communicate with the secure host.

Configuration:
--------------
Edit the shorty_app.conf file to change the default brand/domain where it will be hosted 
and the details for the MongoDB instance.

Notes:
------
 - No hit stats are currently recorded but this would be easy to add into the route 
   subroutine in /lib/ShortyApp/Controller.pm
